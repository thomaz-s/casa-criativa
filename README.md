This aplication was made just for studying, in the online classes of Rocketseat.
The purpose of it is to gather ideias of things to do at home during the quarantine time caused by Covid-19.
It has Express, Nunjucks, Nodemon, SQLite and SQLite 3 as dependencies. At the time I did not have the knowleadge to install the devDependencies apart.
